Hello everyone I am Deepti Doiphode and I have come up with an idea of a photography website as in today's date all of us love taking pictures and post them on social media to show and flaunt  our talent and beauty.Our website is platform for photographers to showcase their talent and for  customers to  get in touch with photographers according to their requirement.

In this project I have used 2 Core services and 1 AI service in Microsoft Azure .

𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞:

•	1.. STATIC WEB APP: First core service is “STATIC WEB APP” using the service I hosted my website, as it automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.  It is used for web hosting for static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images
•	

2. AZURE BLOB STORAGE: Second core service of Microsoft Azure I used is the “AZURE BLOB STORAGE” .  I used it for the purpose of storing my multiple files and folders which I have used in my website. In Azure Blob storage I created a container and I stored my files within that container that files included images, codes, text files, notes, etc.

𝐀𝐈 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞:

3. AZURE AI LANGUAGE SERVICE: The third service that I used is the “AZURE AI LANGUAGE SERVICE”. I used it for creating a CHAT BOT. Using this service I created a chat bot connected it in my website so that questions can be answered with the help of  Chat Bot and people can solve queries they have related to photo delivery, fees, etc.
