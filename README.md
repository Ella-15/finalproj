Topic: Photogenic Us
Hello everyone I am Deepti Doiphode and I have come up with an idea of a photography website as in today's date all of us love taking pictures and post them on social media to show and flaunt  our talent and beauty. Now a days multiple photography tricks are used to make the photography more aesthetic, natural, bright, attractive, etc. Photography and videography is used to capture memories and moments to be kept with us and recollected for a life time.

Services Used =
In this project I have used 2 Core services and 1 AI service in Microsoft Azure .
Core Service:
•	1.. First core service is “STATIC WEB APP” using the service I hosted my website, as it automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.  It is used for web hosting for static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images
•	
2. Second core service of Microsoft Azure I used is the “AZURE BLOB STORAGE” .  I used to Azure blob Storage for the purpose of storing my multiple files and folders which I have used in my website. In Azure Blob storage I created a container and I stored my files within that container that files included images, codes, text files, notes, etc.
AI Service:
The third service that I used is the “AZURE AI LANGUAGE SERVICE”. I used it for creating a CHAT BOT. Using Azure AI language service I created a chat bot of my own and connected it in my website so that a common FAQ can be accessed with the help of that Chat Bot and people can solve queries they have related to photo delivery, fees, etc. I used this service to help build intelligent applications using the web-based Language Studio.
